# Backbone Jasmine examples

This rails app is a container for examples of how to use the Jasmine BDD testing library to test Backbone.js applications.

The examples here are used in a series of articles published on my blog [tinnedfruit.com](http://tinnedfruit.com/2011/03/03/testing-backbone-apps-with-jasmine-sinon.html)

## Installation

This is a barebones Rails 3 application, so uses Bundler for gem dependencies. To install, clone the repository, then:

    > gem install bundler
    > bundle install
    > rake jasmine
  
You can then navigate to http://localhost:8888 in any browser to run the Jasmine spec suite.
